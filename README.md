> Hello everyone! This is Viktor who runs the php-stubs organization. I am planning to stop contributing to the WordPress ecosystem because it is extremely difficult and I do not earn (min) â‚¬100/month.

Please support my work to avoid abandoning this package.

Thank you!

# WordPress Stubs

[![Packagist stats](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs/stats)
[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs.svg?color=4CC61E&style=popout)](https://packagist.org/packages/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs/actions)

It provides stub declarations for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
core functions, classes and interfaces, **globals are not included**.
These stubs can help plugin and theme developers leverage static analysis tools
like [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).

The stubs are generated from [@johnpbloch's package](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress-core)
using [php-stubs/generator](https://github.com/php-stubs/generator).

### Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or 8.0

### Installation

Require this package as a development dependency with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```bash
composer require --dev php-stubs/wordpress-stubs
```

Alternatively you may download `wordpress-stubs.php` directly.

### Usage with PHPStan

```bash
composer require --dev szepeviktor/phpstan-wordpress
```

The package [`szepeviktor/phpstan-wordpress`](https://github.com/szepeviktor/phpstan-wordpress)
depends on [`phpstan/phpstan`](http://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) and this one.
Please do read
[that package's README](https://github.com/szepeviktor/phpstan-wordpress/blob/master/README.md)
and see the `example` directory over there.

### Usage with Psalm

Update your Psalm config to include this section.

```xml
<stubs>
    <file name="vendor/php-stubs/wordpress-stubs/wordpress-stubs.php" />
</stubs>
```

Furthermore ensure WordPress core is _not_ included in `<projectFiles>`.

### Usage in Intellisense

If your IDE has trouble parsing all of WordPress
you may find the stubs useful for enabling code completion and related features.
For example there are [instructions](https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense/issues/113)
for usage with VSCode's
[Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client)
extension.

### Versioning

This package is versioned to match the WordPress version from which the stubs are generated.

### Generating stubs for a different WordPress version

1. Run modern PHP version
1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it
1. Update `"johnpbloch/wordpress": "x.x.x"` in `source/composer.json` with the desired version
1. Run `composer update`
1. And run `./generate.sh`

The `wordpress-stubs.php` file should now be updated.
